<h3><%= image_tag("backpack1.png", size: "40x40")%> My Virtual Pack</h3>
<p>Packs organize your gear into structured units for portability. The intended use determines the type of pack you design. For instance, a pack designed for backcountry travel is typically oriented toward carrying many items with as little added weight as possible, while car travel has fewer weight considerations. Packs intended for air travel should conform to airline carry-on size and baggage check weight limitations to avoid additional fees. Let Gear Goat help you plan your travel appropriately.</p>
<p>Packs are designed for outdoor use, and can be tailored for specific events and difficulty</p>
<p>Select an existing event below to tailor your pack, or add a new event here: <%= link_to "<button>Add new event</button>".html_safe, new_event_path, :id=>"add-pack-btn" %></p>
